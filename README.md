Android Asset Studio Full Size
====================

I didn't understand why everyone put in that extra padding in their icon as there are virtually no phones who actually need it, and what speaks against having a bigger icon than other apps?

I changed nothing but a couple of values and I highly recommend you to check the original project for updates.
